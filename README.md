This overall was a fun project to put together. Please enjoy the comments and abandoned code in each of the files! 
Initially I thought it might be best to create a variable string with all selected characters, but ran into issues when redefining variables within a function, not being able to affect the global value.  Ultimately it was best to work within a series of functions (regular and arrow) to accomplish this task. 

Enjoy!
